 "FAQ": {
    "POPULAR_FAQS": "Popular FAQs",
    "TITLE": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "QUESTION1": "How to build a website?",
    "ANSWER1": "Building a website involves several key steps: First, choose and register a domain name that reflects your brand. Next, select a reliable hosting provider to store your website's files. Then, design and develop your site using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for structure, styling, and interactivity. For more advanced functionality, you can integrate frameworks like React or Angular, or use content management systems (CMS) like WordPress for easier content updates.",
    "QUESTION2": "How long will it take to get a new website?",
    "ANSWER2": "The timeline for building a website varies based on the complexity and scope of the project. A simple website can take 2-3 weeks, while more complex projects with custom features, integrations, or e-commerce functionality may take 4-6 weeks or longer. We work closely with you to establish a clear timeline during the planning phase.",
    "QUESTION3": "Do you only create HTML websites?",
    "ANSWER3": "No, we specialize in a wide range of technologies to suit your needs. Whether you need a static HTML website, a dynamic site built with WordPress, or a modern web application using frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js, we have the expertise to deliver a solution tailored to your goals.",
    "QUESTION4": "Will my website be mobile-friendly?",
    "ANSWER4": "Absolutely. All websites we create are designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring they are fully responsive and optimized for all devices, including smartphones, tablets, and desktops. This guarantees a seamless user experience across all screen sizes.",
    "QUESTION5": "Will you maintain my site for me?",
    "ANSWER5": "Yes, we offer comprehensive maintenance packages to keep your website secure, up-to-date, and running smoothly. Our services include regular updates, backups, security monitoring, and technical support to ensure your site remains in top condition.",
    "QUESTION6": "I’m on a strict budget. Do you have any low-cost options?",
    "ANSWER6": "Yes, we understand that small businesses and startups often have budget constraints. We offer affordable packages that include essential features to get your website up and running without compromising on quality. Let us know your budget, and we’ll work with you to create a solution that fits your needs.",
    "QUESTION7": "Can I update the website myself once it’s built?",
    "ANSWER7": "Yes, we build websites using user-friendly content management systems (CMS) like WordPress, which allow you to easily update content, add blog posts, upload images, and make other changes without needing technical expertise. We also provide training to ensure you’re comfortable managing your site.",
    "QUESTION8": "Do you provide hosting services?",
    "ANSWER8": "Yes, we offer reliable and secure hosting services to ensure your website performs optimally. Our hosting solutions include fast loading speeds, robust security measures, and 24/7 technical support to keep your site running smoothly.
